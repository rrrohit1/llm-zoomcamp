The long tail (red curve) is the result of having a few observations with high values, now the behaviour of the distribution changes, first of all, the area is different on each side and now the mean, median and mode are different.

So in the homework, because the target which is median_house_value is continuous, we had to change it to binary format which in other words, makes its values discrete as either 0 or 1. If we allowed it to remain in the continuous variable format, the mutual information score could be calculated, but the algorithm would have to divide the continuous variables into bins and that would be highly subjective.

      "question: Why do we need the --rm flag\n",
      "answer: What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?\n",
      "For best practice, you don’t want to have a lot of abandoned docker images in your system. You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.\n",
      "They consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.\n",
      "The right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.\n",
      "The option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.\n",
      "During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.\n",

One of the problems we can get at this point is to create the dockerfile as a dockerfile extension Dockerfile.dockerfile which creates an error when we build the docker image. Instead we just need to create the file without extension: Dockerfile and will run perfectly.\n",

      "ETA is the learning rate of the model. XGBoost uses gradient descent to calculate and update the model. In gradient descent, we are looking for the minimum weights that help the model to learn the data very well. This minimum weights for the features is updated each time the model passes through the features and learns the features during training. Tuning the learning rate helps you tell the model what speed it would use in deriving the minimum for the weights.\n",

      "question: What is the difference between bagging and boosting?\n",
      "answer: For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.\n",
      "Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.\n",
      "XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.\n",
      "Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.\n",
      "Mélanie Fouesnard\n",
      "Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.\n",
      "Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.\n",

      "answer: Running a CNN on your CPU can take a long time and once you’ve run out of free time on some cloud providers, it’s time to pay up. Both can be tackled by installing tensorflow with CUDA support on your local machine if you have the right hardware.\n",
      "I was able to get it working by using the following resources:\n",
      "CUDA on WSL :: CUDA Toolkit Documentation (nvidia.com)\n",
      "Install TensorFlow with pip\n",

      "Potential reason: Setting DictVectorizer or OHE to sparse while training, and then storing this in a pipeline or custom object in the benotml model saving stage in train.py. This means that when the custom object is called in service.py, it will convert each input to a different sized sparse matrix, and this can't be batched due to inconsistent length.

      "answer: I’m just looking back at the lessons in week 3 (churn prediction project), and lesson 3.6 talks about Feature Importance for categorical values. At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?\n",
      "Not necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine. There are many feature selection algorithms, it might be interesting to read up on them (among the methods we've learned so far in this course, L1 regularization (Lasso) implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights all the way to zero).\n",

If the target variable is passed in as a parameter while fitting the model, chances are the model would score extremely low.

      "question: Generate Evidently Chart in Grafana\n",
      "answer: Problem: Can we generate charts like Evidently inside Grafana?\n",
      "Solution: In Grafana that would be a stat panel (just a number) and scatter plot panel (I believe it requires a plug-in). However, there is no native way to quickly recreate this exact Evidently dashboard. You'd need to make sure you have all the relevant information logged to your Grafana data source, and then design your own plots in Grafana.\n",
      "If you want to recreate the Evidently visualizations externally, you can export the Evidently output in JSON with include_render=True\n",
      "(more details here https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/customization/json-dict-output) and then parse information from it for your external visualization layer. To include everything you need for non-aggregated visuals, you should also add \"raw_data\": True  option (more details here https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/customization/report-data-aggregation).\n",
      "Overall, this specific plot with under- and over-performance segments is more useful during debugging, so might be easier to access it ad hoc using Evidently.\n",
